# FE interview take-home challenge 1

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Implementation

(Please write about your implementation)

- The project didn't compile correctly after downloading due to some seemingly out of date packages related to create-react-app (properties in webpack config not existing and throwing errors [see this issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/13618)). I didn't want to spend too much time caught up here, so downgrading to eslint8 solved the issue for now.
